        'If you’re an OG, you already know what this is about. \nIf not, I’ll let you in on our secret; The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot.\nI’ve read the series(or part of it) a million times. And just yesterday, I decided that book 3, Third Time Lucky, is my favourite. \nMichael Moscovitz is the character that you’d expect to be the “bad boy”, seeing as he’s the main character’s love interest. But he’s not, and that’s what’s so refreshing about the series. He’s super smart and kind and caring. And to be honest, I can’t believe he actually liked Mia too! He made a whole computer program to respond to her anonymous love letters. 😭\nI wonder how he put up with Mia though. I could never. She talks too much, and asks questions that make you want to break her head! \nYou should read The Princess Diaries, and be bold; read all 10 books. I think everyone would enjoy it, whether they like romance or not. \nIt’s so sad that I have a word limit because I have so much to say. But, I will bid you adieu right here, until next time…\n-JD.',

Pig 1 and Pig 2, why was it a good idea to build your house out of straw or sticks? Anyway, Pig 3 built his own house from bricks, and set a pot of boiling water on the grate, under the chimney, successfully boiling the wolf to death… An ultimate sharp guy. The funniest part is actually when the wolf threatened to huff and puff and blow Pig 3’s house down. Pig 3 was probably smiling and shaking his head at the wolf, but the wolf was forming hard guy. So he huffed and puffed and huffed and puffed, but the house no move… Then Pig 3 looked out the window and probably said something along the lines of “E shock you?” The wolf then thought he was sly and tried to enter into the chimney, only to land in his Waterloo. Our elders say, “First to do, e no dey pain”.In all things, be like the third little pig.\n-JD\nP.S. Listen to Waterloo by ABBA',

        'Briana Matthews (typical Wattpad name, no?) goes to Early College, mostly to escape her mother’s recent death. She gets mixed up with the Order of the Round Table, the secret society she believes has a hand in her mother’s death. She just wants information, and to punish whoever is at fault. But what does she find instead? She finds chaos, war, love, and some truths that she could NEVER have imagined in her wildest dreams. So she’s a black girl in uni right? The traditionalists in the Order believe she should be a servant, seeing as she is a girl and black, but she’s running to be a Scion’s Squire. A Scion is the heir of one of the Knights of the Round Table, and a Squire is the right-hand man. Plus, she has next to zero training on how to fight (next to zero is a fancy way of saying zero). Imagine every single person’s shock when the black girl is not just a Scion herself, but the Scion of Arthur (a.k.a. most powerful). In fact she also has Root-Craft in her blood, so she’s the most powerful thing anyone has seen in centuries. How is this unanedig (human) girl going to lead the Order and win Camlann? Awesome question. Read Legendborn to understand the story and wait with me for the author to complete the series. How cool would it be to be a Knight of King Arthur? Only one way to find out; imagine it. -JD',

        'You’re in your thirties. You’ve achieved much. You’re successful. You’re fashionable, comfortable, married to the best man in the world. Your life is perfect. Your life doesn’t feel like your own. You think you’re a cheat and a fraud. You’re Simisola. This character created by Nikki May is the one everyone wants to be like, on the outside. She’s that cool and collected. “How do you have it all figured out?” Like me, Simi has Impostor’s Syndrome (hereinafter referred to as Impostor’s). Simi dropped out of medical school halfway through the third year, You’d think her father would drop his “Medicine or nothing” act when his daughter actually becomes successful in fashion, the new field she’s chosen. But no! The family’s disgrace will remain the family’s disgrace as long as she’s playing dress up when she was destined to save lives. So, she has no idea how come she’s where she is. The horror stories flood your head. The streets are not kind even when you’re a graduate. The streets are diabolical when you’re a drop out. Simi is successfully breaking those stereotypes. That’s a good thing, right? Not when you have Impostor’s. Like Simi, everyday I wonder why things work out for me. I don’t deserve any of that. I’m not half as good as my mates. I relate with Simi to such a large extent (not completely, but you’d have to read Wahala to know why). It’s so exhausting to do really well in so many things, but stay up at night explaining to yourself why you don’t deserve any of the accolades (when you actually do). Why am I ranting about Impostor’s? I’m sick of it. If you have any tips… please comment them. For now, that’s all on today’s episode of Relating to Characters (a thing I just made up). Remember, there’s a thin line between reality and fantasy. Cross it. -JD',

I’m a plain Jane, except… Many interesting things happen to me, but only in my head. For this blog, I’ll talk about one relatable character from a book I’ve read, every week. Expect at least one post a week, for five weeks. I hope you find this interesting enough to stick with me. But until next time… Farewell, and always cross the bridge between fantasy and reality, whether I am with you, or nay. -JD',
