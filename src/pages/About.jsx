			<h1>About Ebube.writes</h1>
			<p>
				Ebube.writes is a quiet corner for people who love books and the feelings
				they leave behind. Here, I write about what I’m reading; novels,
				essays, poems, and how they shape the way I think, feel, and move
				through the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are not summaries or rankings. They are reflections. Small
				attempts to sit with a story a little longer, to trace the aftertaste
				of a good sentence, and to notice the way certain books soften or steady
				us.
			</p>
			<p>
				Think of this blog as literature, distilled for the cure of seemingly
				incurable happiness. Triple filtered. Extra smooth.
